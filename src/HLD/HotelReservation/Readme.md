# üè® Hotel Reservation System - HLD (Interview Notes)

## 1. Problem Statement
Design a **Hotel Reservation System** (similar to Marriott, Booking.com, Airbnb) that allows:
- Browsing hotels and rooms.
- Making and managing reservations.
- Handling concurrency (multiple users booking the same room).
- Scaling to millions of users and hotels.

---

## 2. Requirements

### ‚úÖ Functional
1. Search hotel (by city, date, price, amenities).
2. View hotel & room details.
3. Reserve a room.
4. Cancel / update reservation.
5. Admin operations (add/update hotel/room).

### ‚ö° Non-Functional
- **Scalability** ‚Üí Handle millions of rooms & concurrent bookings.
- **Availability** ‚Üí Always bookable (99.99% uptime).
- **Consistency** ‚Üí Prevent overbooking.
- **Latency** ‚Üí Low response times (<200ms for search).
- **Reliability & Fault Tolerance** ‚Üí Recover from crashes.
- **Concurrency** ‚Üí Handle multiple people booking same room at same time.

---

## 3. Back-of-the-Envelope Estimations
- 5,000 hotels ‚Üí 1M rooms.
- 70% occupancy ‚Üí ~700K active reservations daily.
- Avg stay: 3 days ‚Üí ~233K bookings/day.
- Per second: ~3 bookings/sec (peak √ó 10 = 30/sec).

---

## 4. API Design (RESTful)

### üîπ Hotel APIs

## 5. Data Modeling

### Relational DB (SQL) ‚Äì For Consistency

- **Hotel** (`id`, `name`, `address`, `location`)
- **Room** (`id`, `hotelId`, `type`, `price`, `status`)
- **Reservation** (`id`, `userId`, `hotelId`, `roomId`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `status`)
- **User** (`id`, `name`, `email`, `loyaltyPoints`)

### NoSQL ‚Äì For Scalability (Search, Caching)

- Room availability index (by hotel, date)
- Reservation history per user

---

### Why SQL DB over NoSQL for Core Design?

- **Strong Consistency:** SQL databases provide ACID properties, ensuring no overbooking and accurate reservations.
- **Complex Relationships:** Hotel, room, reservation, and user entities have clear relationships, easily modeled with foreign keys and joins.
- **Transactional Support:** Multi-step operations (e.g., booking, payment) require atomic transactions, which SQL handles natively.
- **Data Integrity:** Constraints and schemas enforce data validity, reducing errors.
- **Mature Querying:** SQL supports complex queries and reporting, useful for analytics and admin operations.

*NoSQL is used for high-speed search, caching, and denormalized views, but core transactional data benefits from SQL‚Äôs consistency and integrity guarantees.*

## 7. Concurrency Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Same user clicks "Book" multiple times

**Solution:**  
Idempotent API (use `reservationId` as an idempotency key to prevent duplicate bookings).

### Problem 2: Multiple users try to book the same room

**Solutions:**
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Lock the row until the transaction finishes.
- **Optimistic Locking:** Use version/timestamp; retry if there is a version mismatch.
- **Database Constraints:** Enforce `CHECK (availableRooms >= 0)` to prevent overbooking.

---

## 8. Algorithms & Techniques

### üîπ Idempotent API
- Ensures the same request does not create duplicate bookings.
- **Example:** Stripe, PayPal use idempotency keys for payments.

### üîπ Pessimistic Locking
- Row is locked until the transaction finishes.
- Prevents overbooking but reduces throughput.

### üîπ Optimistic Locking
- Uses version numbers or timestamps.
- If version mismatch, retry the operation.
- Higher throughput, but may require retries.

### üîπ Sharding
- Partition data by `HotelID` or region.
- **Example:** Marriott hotels in EU vs US stored separately.

### üîπ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Writes go to the Reservation DB.
- Reads are served via cache/replica.
- **Example:** Airbnb, Uber.

### üîπ Saga Pattern
- For distributed transactions (e.g., booking + payment).
- Reservation marked as "pending" until payment is confirmed.

---

## 9. Tradeoffs & Tweaks

- **Consistency vs Availability:**  
  Use strong consistency for booking, eventual consistency for search.
- **SQL + NoSQL Hybrid:**  
  Strong ACID guarantees in reservations, high-scale search in ElasticSearch.
- **Caching Strategy:**  
  LRU eviction, write-through for reservations.
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff:**  
  For optimistic locking conflicts.
- **Event-Driven Compensation:**  
  For handling cancellations and failed payments.

---

## 10. What Interviewers Look For

- **Requirement Gathering:** Did you clarify functional and non-functional needs?
- **Scale Estimation:** Can you do back-of-the-envelope math?
- **API & Data Model:** Did you design extensible, RESTful APIs?
- **System Design Principles:** Caching, DB choice, sharding, load balancing.
- **Consistency & Concurrency Handling:** Prevent overbooking with ACID.

- **Security:** Data encryption, secure APIs (OAuth/JWT).
- **Real-world Parallels:** Can you relate design to systems like Airbnb, Marriott, Booking.com?

---

## 11. Example Interview Tweaks

- **Q:** What if Marriott has 100M rooms worldwide?  
  **A:** Introduce geo-sharding and CDN-based caching.

- **Q:** How to handle cancellations?  
  **A:** Use soft deletes and event-driven compensation workflows.

- **Q:** What if payment fails midway?  
  **A:** Use the Saga Pattern (reservation marked "pending" until payment is confirmed).

# üöÄ Add-ons & Advanced Considerations

## 1. Reliability & Fault Tolerance
- **Circuit Breaker** ‚Üí Prevent cascading failures if Payment Service/DB is down.
- **Retry with Backoff** ‚Üí For transient failures (network issues).
- **Failover DB replicas** ‚Üí Master-Slave or Leader-Follower.
- **Graceful degradation** ‚Üí If recommendation service fails, still allow booking.

---

## 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Use **Kafka / Kinesis** for:
   - Reservation confirmed ‚Üí Trigger email/notification service.
   - Payment failed ‚Üí Trigger cancellation event.
   - Room availability update ‚Üí Notify Search Index service.
- Ensures **loose coupling** and **async processing**.

---

## 3. Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: Bookings/sec, Failures/sec, DB latency, Cache hit ratio.
- **Logging**: Trace by reservationId (use correlation IDs).
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger / Zipkin for debugging microservice flow.
- **Dashboards**: Grafana + Prometheus.

---

## 4. Security & Compliance
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 / JWT for APIs.
- **Authorization**: RBAC (Admin vs Customer).
- **PCI DSS compliance**: For handling payments.
- **Data Encryption**: TLS in transit, AES at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse (e.g., search spam).

---

## 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Write-through cache** ‚Üí Update Redis + DB for reservation confirmation.
- **Read replicas** ‚Üí Serve search queries from replicas, not primary DB.
- **ElasticSearch** ‚Üí Full-text search on hotels/amenities.
- **CDN** ‚Üí Serve hotel images, static content.
- **Hot Partitioning** ‚Üí Detect hotels with extremely high traffic (e.g., conference city) and rebalance shards.

---

## 6. Scalability Enhancements
- **Geo-Sharding**: Split DBs by region (US, EU, APAC).
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Active-Active setup with global load balancer (Cloudflare, AWS Route53).
- **Autoscaling**: Horizontal scaling of Reservation service under load.
- **Async Payment Confirmation**: Don‚Äôt block booking flow if payment takes time.

---

## 7. Advanced Patterns
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions (Booking + Payment + Notification).
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models (fast search vs consistent booking).
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintain history of all booking state changes (auditability).
- **Bulkhead Isolation**: Contain failures (if payment fails, search service unaffected).

---

## 8. Interview-Winning Insights
- Always highlight **Consistency vs Availability tradeoff**:
   - *Booking = Strong Consistency (ACID).*
   - *Search/Recommendation = Eventual Consistency.*
- Show **real-world analogies**: ‚ÄúAirbnb uses ElasticSearch for listings, Stripe-like idempotency keys for payments.‚Äù
- Stress on **failure handling**: *‚ÄúWhat happens if payment succeeds but reservation DB write fails?‚Äù ‚Üí Saga rollback.*
- Discuss **growth path**: Start with monolith ‚Üí modularize ‚Üí microservices ‚Üí geo-distributed system.

## 2) Sequence Diagram - Booking Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant User
  participant Gateway
  participant Reservation as Reservation Service
  participant Room as Room Service
  participant Pay as Payment Service
  participant RDB as Reservation DB
  participant Cache as Redis
  participant Bus as Kafka

  User->>Gateway: POST /v1/reservations (idempotency-key)
  Gateway->>Reservation: CreateReservation(cmd)
  Note over Reservation: Validate request & dates

  Reservation->>Room: Hold(roomTypeId, hotelId, dates)
  Room-->>Reservation: HoldToken / Failure

  alt Hold acquired
    Reservation->>Pay: Authorize(amount, idempotency-key)
    Pay-->>Reservation: AuthSuccess(txnId) / Fail
    alt Payment success
      Reservation->>RDB: INSERT reservation (PENDING->CONFIRMED) TX
      RDB-->>Reservation: OK
      Reservation->>Cache: Invalidate availability cache
      Reservation-->>Gateway: 200 OK (reservationId)
      Reservation->>Bus: reservation.confirmed event
    else Payment failure
      Reservation->>Room: ReleaseHold(HoldToken)
      Reservation-->>Gateway: 402 Payment Required
    end
  else Hold failed
    Reservation-->>Gateway: 409 Conflict (no availability)
  end
```
## 3) Optimistic Locking on Availability (RoomType Inventory)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Res as Reservation Service
  participant Inv as Inventory Table
  participant DB as SQL DB

  Res->>DB: SELECT available, version FROM inventory WHERE hotelId=X AND roomType=Y AND date=D
  DB-->>Res: available=A, version=V

  alt A > 0
    Res->>DB: UPDATE inventory SET available=A-1, version=V+1 WHERE hotelId=X AND roomType=Y AND date=D AND version=V
    DB-->>Res: rowsAffected = 1
    Res-->>Res: Success -> continue flow
  else A == 0
    Res-->>Res: Reject (409)
  end

  opt Concurrent attempt
    Res->>DB: UPDATE ... WHERE version=V  (stale)
    DB-->>Res: rowsAffected = 0  (conflict)
    Res-->>Res: Retry with backoff+jitter
  end
```
## 4) Pessimistic Locking on Availability (RoomType Inventory)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Res as Reservation Service
  participant DB as SQL DB

  Res->>DB: BEGIN
  Res->>DB: SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE id=:invId FOR UPDATE
  DB-->>Res: Row locked
  Res-->>DB: UPDATE inventory SET available=available-1 WHERE id=:invId AND available>0
  DB-->>Res: OK / 0 rows (sold out)
  Res->>DB: COMMIT / ROLLBACK
```
### 5) Saga Pattern (Reservation + Payment + Notification)
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Pending
  Pending --> PaymentAuthorized : Auth OK
  Pending --> Cancelled : HoldExpired / Auth Fail

  PaymentAuthorized --> Confirmed : DB write OK
  PaymentAuthorized --> Compensating : DB write fail

  Compensating --> Cancelled : ReleaseHold + Refund

  Confirmed --> Notified : Emit event -> Email/SMS
  Notified --> [*]
```
## 6) CQRS Pattern (Read/Write Separation)
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[(Reservation DB - Write)]
  E[reservation.events]
  C[(Redis - Availability Cache)]
  Q[(Read Replica / ES Index)]

  R -- CDC/Outbox --> E
  E --> C
  E --> Q
```
* Outbox ensures ‚Äúwrite + publish‚Äù is atomic (avoids phantom successes/failures).
* Read side is eventually consistent; booking write path is strongly consistent.

### 7) Capacity Planning Cheat Sheet
* Occupancy ‚âà rooms * 0.7
* Daily bookings ‚âà occupancy / avgStayDays
* Peak QPS ‚âà dailyBookings / 86400 * 10
* Cache hit target: ‚â• 90% for search & hotel details
* P99 latency targets: Search < 300ms, Create booking < 800ms (excluding long payments)

### 8) Idempotent API ‚Äì Minimal Pseudocode
```json
   handleCreateReservation(req):
   key = req.headers["Idempotency-Key"]
   if key is missing: return 400

if entry := IdempotencyStore.get(key):
return entry.response  // exact replay

// store 'in-flight' marker to prevent duplicates
IdempotencyStore.putIfAbsent(key, {status: IN_PROGRESS, ts: now()})

try:
result = processBooking(req)  // includes hold + auth + insert
IdempotencyStore.put(key, {status: DONE, response: result})
return result
catch e:
// store error response too (to make retries deterministic)
IdempotencyStore.put(key, {status: DONE, response: mapError(e)})
throw
```
### 9) Availability Table (Per-Day Inventory) ‚Äì SQL Sketch
```SQL
   CREATE TABLE room_inventory (
   hotel_id    BIGINT,
   room_type   TEXT,
   date        DATE,
   available   INT NOT NULL,
   version     BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
   PRIMARY KEY (hotel_id, room_type, date)
   );
```
### Optimistic decrement
```SQL
UPDATE room_inventory
SET available = available - 1, version = version + 1
WHERE hotel_id = :h AND room_type = :rt AND date = :d
AND available > 0 AND version = :v;
```

### 10) What to Say if Asked ‚ÄúScale to 100M Rooms?‚Äù

* Geo-shard by region; route users via GSLB/Anycast to nearest region.
* Put inventory in region-local primaries; cross-region reads via replicas.
* Use time-bucketed partitions (date as partition key) to keep hot ranges small.
* Hot city surge ‚Üí spillover shards + adaptive throttles on search.
* Multi-CDN for images; Edge KV for static hotel metadata.
