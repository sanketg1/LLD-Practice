How are this url mapped what's apidevkey and is it for logged in user  
URL Mapping and api_dev_key  
URL Mapping: The system maps a long URL to a short URL by generating a unique short key (using a sequencer and Base-58 encoding). This short key is stored in the database along with the original long URL. When a user accesses the short URL, the system looks up the original URL from this mapping to redirect the user.

api_dev_key: This is a unique identifier for the user making the API request. It helps the system identify and authenticate the user, enforce rate limits, and track usage.

Is api_dev_key for logged-in users? The lesson assumes the service does not require user registration for generating short URLs, so user login is not mandatory. However, api_dev_key can still be used to uniquely identify users or clients (like developers using the API) even without formal login.

Let me know if you want more details on any part of this process!

what db to store  
Database Choice for URL Shortening Service  
The lesson suggests using a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB, for storing data.

Reasons for choosing MongoDB:

- It supports horizontal scalability, which is important as the system grows.
- Uses a leader-follower protocol allowing replicas to handle heavy read loads efficiently.
- Ensures atomicity in concurrent write operations and prevents duplicate records by returning errors on duplicate keys.

Data stored includes:
- User details (if applicable)
- Mappings of short URLs to original long URLs

Since the system is read-heavy and records have minimal relationships, NoSQL is a suitable choice over relational databases.

If you want, I can explain how the data schema might look or how scalability is handled in MongoDB.

why we reequire cache whe we can store it in has map for each instance  
Why Use Cache Instead of Just a Hash Map per Instance

- **Scalability:** A hash map stored locally on each instance is limited to that instanceâ€™s memory and is not shared across servers. This means cache misses on one server require database access, reducing efficiency.
- **Consistency:** With multiple instances, local hash maps can become inconsistent. A centralized cache like Memcached ensures a consistent, shared cache across all servers.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Memcached is horizontally scalable and can handle large volumes of read requests efficiently, which is crucial for a read-heavy system like URL redirection.
- **Latency:** Local hash maps are fast but limited in size and scope. A distributed cache reduces database load and improves response times globally.
- **Data Center Specific Caching:** The lesson suggests using a data-center-specific caching layer to reduce latency further, which is not possible with isolated hash maps.

In summary, a distributed cache like Memcached provides better scalability, consistency, and performance compared to local hash maps on each instance.
