## 1. Handling Overbooking and Concurrency Control

**Problem:**  
Multiple booking requests for the same room can be processed simultaneously, causing overbooking.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Use **locking mechanisms** (e.g., pessimistic locking) on room records during booking to prevent concurrent modifications.
2. Implement **optimistic locking** with version checks to detect conflicts and retry booking.
3. Use a **transactional system** with ACID properties to ensure atomicity of booking operations.
4. Introduce a **booking queue** or **reservation hold system** to serialize booking requests.

**Design Consideration:**  
Ensure the booking status is updated atomically to **"Booked"** only after payment confirmation.
## 1. Handling Overbooking and Concurrency Control

### üõ†Ô∏è Design Suggestions:
- Add a **version** or **lock** attribute to the `Room` or `RoomBooking` class to implement **optimistic locking**.
- Use **database transactions** to wrap the booking process, including checking availability and updating booking status.
- Introduce a **BookingStatus** state machine to handle states like `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, and `CANCELLED`.
- Implement a **reservation hold period** where a room is temporarily locked for a user until payment is confirmed.

---

### üíª Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode):

```java
class RoomBooking {
    private int version; // for optimistic locking
    private BookingStatus status;

    public synchronized boolean bookRoom() {
        if (status != BookingStatus.AVAILABLE) {
            return false; // room already booked or held
        }
        // Lock the room for booking
        status = BookingStatus.PENDING;
        // Proceed with payment and confirmation
        return true;
    }

    public synchronized void confirmBooking() {
        status = BookingStatus.CONFIRMED;
        version++;
    }

    public synchronized void cancelBooking() {
        status = BookingStatus.AVAILABLE;
        version++;
    }
}

// In the booking service layer:
public boolean attemptBooking(RoomBooking booking) {
    try {
        beginTransaction();
        if (!booking.bookRoom()) {
            rollbackTransaction();
            return false;
        }
        // Process payment
        if (paymentSuccessful()) {
            booking.confirmBooking();
            commitTransaction();
            return true;
        } else {
            booking.cancelBooking();
            rollbackTransaction();
            return false;
        }
    } catch (OptimisticLockException e) {
        rollbackTransaction();
        // Retry or notify user
        return false;
    }
}
üìå Key Points:

Use synchronized methods or database locks to avoid race conditions.

Wrap booking and payment in a single transaction to maintain consistency.

Use optimistic locking to detect concurrent updates and handle retries.

## Deep Dive: Managing Partial Payments and Payment Failures

### Design Improvements
- **Payment State Tracking:** Extend the `PaymentStatus` enum to include `PARTIALLY_PAID`, `FAILED`, and `RETRYING` states.  
- **Payment History:** Maintain a list of payment attempts in `BillTransaction` to track retries and partial payments.  
- **Timeouts and Expiry:** Implement a timeout for pending payments to automatically cancel bookings if full payment isn‚Äôt received in time.  
- **Retry Logic:** Add automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures (e.g., network issues).  
- **User Notifications:** Notify guests on each payment status change (partial payment received, failure, retry).  
- **Flexible Payment Methods:** Allow multiple payment methods to be combined for full payment.

### Enhanced Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode)
```java
enum PaymentStatus {
    PENDING,
    PARTIALLY_PAID,
    PAID,
    FAILED,
    RETRYING
}

class PaymentAttempt {
    double amount;
    Date timestamp;
    PaymentStatus status;

    public PaymentAttempt(double amount, PaymentStatus status) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.status = status;
        this.timestamp = new Date();
    }
}

class BillTransaction {
    private double amountDue;
    private double amountPaid = 0.0;
    private PaymentStatus paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.PENDING;
    private List<PaymentAttempt> paymentHistory = new ArrayList<>();

    public synchronized boolean makePayment(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0 || amount > (amountDue - amountPaid)) {
            return false; // invalid payment amount
        }
        // Simulate payment processing
        boolean success = processPayment(amount);
        if (success) {
            amountPaid += amount;
            paymentHistory.add(new PaymentAttempt(amount, PaymentStatus.PAID));
            if (amountPaid == amountDue) {
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.PAID;
            } else {
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_PAID;
            }
            notifyGuestPaymentStatus();
            return true;
        } else {
            paymentHistory.add(new PaymentAttempt(amount, PaymentStatus.FAILED));
            paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.FAILED;
            notifyGuestPaymentFailure();
            return false;
        }
    }

    private boolean processPayment(double amount) {
        // Implement actual payment gateway integration here
        return true; // Assume success for now
    }

    private void notifyGuestPaymentStatus() {
        // Send notification about payment status
    }

    private void notifyGuestPaymentFailure() {
        // Send notification about payment failure and retry options
    }

    public void retryFailedPayments() {
        for (PaymentAttempt attempt : paymentHistory) {
            if (attempt.status == PaymentStatus.FAILED) {
                paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.RETRYING;
                boolean retrySuccess = processPayment(attempt.amount);
                if (retrySuccess) {
                    amountPaid += attempt.amount;
                    attempt.status = PaymentStatus.PAID;
                    if (amountPaid == amountDue) {
                        paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.PAID;
                    } else {
                        paymentStatus = PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_PAID;
                    }
                    notifyGuestPaymentStatus();
                } else {
                    notifyGuestPaymentFailure();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

class RoomBooking {
    private BookingStatus bookingStatus;
    private BillTransaction billTransaction;

    public void updateBookingStatus() {
        switch (billTransaction.getPaymentStatus()) {
            case PAID:
                bookingStatus = BookingStatus.CONFIRMED;
                break;
            case PARTIALLY_PAID:
                bookingStatus = BookingStatus.PENDING;
                break;

            case RETRYING:
                bookingStatus = BookingStatus.PAYMENT_FAILED;
                break;
            default:
                bookingStatus = BookingStatus.PENDING;
        }
    }
}
Key Takeaways

Track each payment attempt for audit and retry.

Booking status reflects payment progress.

Notify guests proactively about payment issues.

Support retries to improve payment success rates.

## Implementing Cancellation and Refund Flows

### Design Suggestions
- **Cancellation Method:** Add a `cancel()` method in the `RoomBooking` class to handle booking cancellations.  
- **Cancellation Status Tracking:** Introduce a `CancellationStatus` enum with states like `REQUESTED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, and `REFUNDED`.  
- **Refund Tracking:** Store refund status and amount in the `BillTransaction` class.  
- **Refund Policies:** Define rules (full, partial, or no refund) based on cancellation timing.  
- **User Notifications:** Integrate triggers to inform guests about cancellation and refund status.  

---

### Enhanced Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode)
```java
enum CancellationStatus {
    NONE,
    REQUESTED,
    APPROVED,
    REJECTED,
    REFUNDED
}

class RoomBooking {
    private BookingStatus bookingStatus;
    private CancellationStatus cancellationStatus = CancellationStatus.NONE;
    private BillTransaction billTransaction;

    public boolean cancelBooking() {
        if (bookingStatus == BookingStatus.CHECKED_IN || bookingStatus == BookingStatus.CHECKED_OUT) {
            return false; // Cannot cancel after check-in
        }
        cancellationStatus = CancellationStatus.REQUESTED;
        
        // Business logic to approve or reject cancellation
        if (approveCancellation()) {
            cancellationStatus = CancellationStatus.APPROVED;
            processRefund();
            bookingStatus = BookingStatus.CANCELLED;
            return true;
        } else {
            cancellationStatus = CancellationStatus.REJECTED;
            return false;
        }
    }

    private boolean approveCancellation() {
        // Implement policy checks (e.g., cancellation window)
        return true; // Assume approval for simplicity
    }

    private void processRefund() {
        double refundAmount = calculateRefundAmount();
        billTransaction.refund(refundAmount);
        cancellationStatus = CancellationStatus.REFUNDED;
        notifyGuestCancellationAndRefund(refundAmount);
    }

    private double calculateRefundAmount() {
        // Implement refund policy logic here
        return billTransaction.getAmountPaid(); // Full refund example
    }

    private void notifyGuestCancellationAndRefund(double amount) {
        // Send notification to guest
    }
}

class BillTransaction {
    private double amountPaid;
    private double refundAmount = 0.0;

    public void refund(double amount) {
        if (amount <= amountPaid) {
            refundAmount = amount;
            amountPaid -= amount;
            // Update payment status if needed
        }
    }
}
Key Points

Cancellation is only allowed before check-in.

Refund amount is calculated based on policy rules.

Statuses for booking and cancellation are updated accordingly.

Guests receive notifications for both cancellation and refund.

## Accounting for Room Maintenance and Availability

### Design Suggestions
- **New Room Status:** Add a `UNDER_MAINTENANCE` status to the existing `RoomStatus` enum to represent rooms unavailable due to maintenance.  
- **Maintenance Scheduling:** Add a `maintenanceSchedules` attribute or a dedicated `MaintenanceSchedule` class to track blocked periods.  
- **Booking Logic Update:** Modify search and booking logic to exclude rooms under maintenance.  
- **Maintenance Workflow:** Implement `startMaintenance()` and `endMaintenance()` methods to update status and trigger notifications.  
- **Operational Communication:** Notify housekeeping and reception teams about maintenance schedules.  

---

### Enhanced Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode)
```java
enum RoomStatus {
    AVAILABLE,
    BOOKED,
    UNDER_MAINTENANCE,
    OUT_OF_SERVICE
}

class Room {
    private RoomStatus status;
    private List<MaintenanceSchedule> maintenanceSchedules;

    public boolean isAvailableForBooking(Date checkIn, Date checkOut) {
        if (status != RoomStatus.AVAILABLE) {
            return false;
        }
        for (MaintenanceSchedule ms : maintenanceSchedules) {
            if (ms.overlapsWith(checkIn, checkOut)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public void startMaintenance(MaintenanceSchedule schedule) {
        maintenanceSchedules.add(schedule);
        status = RoomStatus.UNDER_MAINTENANCE;
        notifyTeamsMaintenanceStarted();
    }

    public void endMaintenance(MaintenanceSchedule schedule) {
        maintenanceSchedules.remove(schedule);
        if (maintenanceSchedules.isEmpty()) {
            status = RoomStatus.AVAILABLE;
        }
        notifyTeamsMaintenanceEnded();
    }

    private void notifyTeamsMaintenanceStarted() {
        // Notify housekeeping, reception, etc.
    }

    private void notifyTeamsMaintenanceEnded() {
        // Notify housekeeping, reception, etc.
    }
}

class MaintenanceSchedule {
    private Date startDate;
    private Date endDate;

    public boolean overlapsWith(Date checkIn, Date checkOut) {
        return !(checkOut.before(startDate) || checkIn.after(endDate));
    }
}
5. Handling Notification Failures and Retries
Design Suggestions:

Make the Notification class robust by adding retry logic for failed notifications.
Maintain a status and retry count for each notification attempt.
Use exponential backoff or fixed intervals between retries.
Log failures for audit and troubleshooting.
Provide fallback mechanisms (e.g., if SMS fails, try email).
Notify system admins if repeated failures occur.
Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode):

abstract class Notification {
    protected int retryCount = 0;
    protected final int maxRetries = 3;
    protected NotificationStatus status = NotificationStatus.PENDING;

    public void send() {
        boolean success = sendNotification();
        if (success) {
            status = NotificationStatus.SENT;
        } else {
            status = NotificationStatus.FAILED;
            retrySend();
        }
    }

    protected abstract boolean sendNotification();

    private void retrySend() {
        while (retryCount < maxRetries && status == NotificationStatus.FAILED) {
            retryCount++;
            try {
                Thread.sleep(calculateBackoffTime(retryCount));
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Handle interruption
            }
            boolean success = sendNotification();
            if (success) {
                status = NotificationStatus.SENT;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (status == NotificationStatus.FAILED) {
            notifyAdmin();
        }
    }

    private long calculateBackoffTime(int retryCount) {
        return 1000L * (long) Math.pow(2, retryCount); // Exponential backoff
    }

    private void notifyAdmin() {
        // Send alert to system admin about notification failure
    }
}

class SMSNotification extends Notification {
    @Override
    protected boolean sendNotification() {
        // Implement SMS sending logic
        return true; // Assume success for example
    }
}

class EmailNotification extends Notification {
    @Override
    protected boolean sendNotification() {
        // Implement Email sending logic
        return true; // Assume success for example
    }
}

enum NotificationStatus {
    PENDING,
    SENT,
    FAILED
}
Key Points:

Retry sending notifications up to a max limit.
Use exponential backoff to avoid spamming.
Notify admins on persistent failures.
Support fallback channels if primary fails.

## Supporting Multiple Guests per Booking

### Design Suggestions
- **Multiple Guest Support:** Modify `RoomBooking` to store a list of `Guest` objects instead of a single guest.  
- **Group Representation:** Create a `GuestGroup` or `BookingParty` class to manage multiple guests under one booking.  
- **Billing & Notifications:** Ensure all guests are accounted for in billing, check-in, and notifications.  
- **Capacity Validation:** Update booking logic to validate guest count against room capacity.  

---

### Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode)
```java
class Guest {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String phoneNumber;
    // Additional guest details, e.g., ID proof, special requests
}

class RoomBooking {
    private List<Guest> guests = new ArrayList<>();
    private BookingStatus bookingStatus;
    private BillTransaction billTransaction;

    public void addGuest(Guest guest) {
        guests.add(guest);
    }

    public void addGuests(List<Guest> guestList) {
        guests.addAll(guestList);
    }

    public List<Guest> getGuests() {
        return guests;
    }

    public boolean validateCapacity(int roomCapacity) {
        return guests.size() <= roomCapacity;
    }

    // Other booking-related methods
}

// Example usage:
RoomBooking booking = new RoomBooking();
booking.addGuest(new Guest("Alice Smith", "alice@example.com", "1234567890"));
booking.addGuest(new Guest("Bob Johnson", "bob@example.com", "0987654321"));


Key Points

Each booking can include multiple guests.

Guest information is stored and managed collectively.

Room capacity checks prevent over-occupancy.

Billing, check-in, and notifications are guest-aware.


## Managing Time Zone Differences Across Hotel Branches

### Design Suggestions
- **Branch Time Zone Tracking:** Store time zone information for each `HotelBranch` or `Hotel` entity.  
- **Timezone-Aware Data Types:** Use `ZonedDateTime` (Java) or `datetime` with time zone info (Python) for all booking, check-in, and check-out times.  
- **Consistent Local Time:** Convert all user inputs and system operations to the branch‚Äôs local time zone.  
- **Guest-Friendly Display:** Present booking details in the guest‚Äôs preferred time zone if available.  
- **DST Handling:** Account for daylight saving time transitions to avoid booking confusion.  

---

### Code Suggestions (Java-like pseudocode)
```java
class HotelBranch {
    private String name;
    private ZoneId timeZone; // Example: ZoneId.of("America/New_York")

    public ZoneId getTimeZone() {
        return timeZone;
    }
}

class RoomBooking {
    private ZonedDateTime checkInDateTime;
    private ZonedDateTime checkOutDateTime;
    private HotelBranch hotelBranch;

    public void setCheckInDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime) {
        this.checkInDateTime = ZonedDateTime.of(localDateTime, hotelBranch.getTimeZone());
    }

    public ZonedDateTime getCheckInDateTimeInGuestTZ(ZoneId guestTimeZone) {
        return checkInDateTime.withZoneSameInstant(guestTimeZone);
    }

    // Similar methods for checkOutDateTime
}

// Example usage:
HotelBranch branch = new HotelBranch();
branch.timeZone = ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata");

RoomBooking booking = new RoomBooking();
booking.hotelBranch = branch;
booking.setCheckInDateTime(LocalDateTime.of(2024, 7, 1, 14, 0));

ZoneId guestTZ = ZoneId.of("America/Los_Angeles");
ZonedDateTime guestCheckIn = booking.getCheckInDateTimeInGuestTZ(guestTZ);
System.out.println("Guest check-in time: " + guestCheckIn);


Key Points:

Time zone info is tied to hotel branches.
Use timezone-aware datetime objects to avoid confusion.
Convert times appropriately for guests and system operations.
Consider daylight saving and regional differences.
