# The Mediator Design Pattern using Java

Imagine an auction system where multiple bidders are excitedly placing their bids. Instead of all bidders talking to each other directly—which would be chaotic and messy—we introduce a central auction house that coordinates everything. This auction house is our mediator! It makes communication smooth and structured, reducing direct dependencies between bidders. Ready to dive in? Let’s go! 🚀

## The Auction Mayhem: A Traditional Approach Gone Wild 🎯💥

Imagine our auction system without any mediator. Every bidder has to know about every other bidder to communicate a new bid. Let’s see how that might look:

```java
class Bidder {
    String name;
    int bid;
    public Bidder(String name) { this.name = name; }
    // Direct communication with all other bidders (messy!)
    public void placeBid(int amount, Bidder[] bidders) {
        this.bid = amount;
        System.out.println(name + " placed a bid: " + amount);
        for (Bidder b : bidders) {
            if (b != this) {
                b.receiveBid(this, amount);
            }
        }
    }
    public void receiveBid(Bidder bidder, int amount) {
        System.out.println(name + " is notified: " + bidder.name +
            " placed a bid of " + amount);
    }
}
public class AuctionTraditionalDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bidder bidder1 = new Bidder("Alice");
        Bidder bidder2 = new Bidder("Bob");
        Bidder bidder3 = new Bidder("Charlie");
        Bidder[] bidders = {bidder1, bidder2, bidder3};
        // Each bidder directly communicates with others
        bidder1.placeBid(100, bidders);
        bidder2.placeBid(150, bidders);
        bidder3.placeBid(200, bidders);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Every bidder directly notifies all other bidders when placing a bid.
- As more bidders or features are added, this approach becomes tangled and hard to manage. 😵

## The Interviewer Questions: "This Looks Messy—How Can You Improve It?" 🤔

Imagine you're in an interview and the interviewer points out that the direct communication between bidders creates a lot of dependencies and clutter. They ask, “How would you refactor this code to make it cleaner and more scalable?” Yikes! That's when you realize the need for a centralized mediator.

---

## The Ugly Truth: A Tangled Web of Direct Communication 😬💔

Let’s take a peek at an even more cluttered version, where every bidder not only places bids but also handles multiple extra responsibilities:

```java
// Messy version: Each bidder handles bidding, logging, and notifications directly
class Bidder {
    String name;
    int bid;
    public Bidder(String name) { this.name = name; }
    // A cluttered method that handles bidding and additional responsibilities
    public void placeBidWithExtras(int amount, Bidder[] bidders) {
        // Update bid and log the bid placement
        this.bid = amount;
        System.out.println("[" + name + "] placed a bid: " + amount);
        System.out.println("LOG: " + name + " bid " + amount + " at " +
            System.currentTimeMillis());

        // Directly notify every other bidder with additional responsibilities
        for (Bidder b : bidders) {
            if (b != this) {
                b.receiveBidWithExtras(this, amount);
            }
        }
    }

    // Cluttered notification method with extra tasks (like simulating an email notification)
    public void receiveBidWithExtras(Bidder bidder, int amount) {
        System.out.println("[" + name + "] is notified: " + bidder.name +
            " placed a bid of " + amount);
        System.out.println("EMAIL: Sending email to " + name +
            " about the bid from " + bidder.name);
    }
}
public class AuctionUglyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating bidders without a central mediator
        Bidder bidder1 = new Bidder("Alice");
        Bidder bidder2 = new Bidder("Bob");
        Bidder bidder3 = new Bidder("Charlie");
        Bidder[] bidders = {bidder1, bidder2, bidder3};
        // Each bidder is responsible for handling the bid and all associated extras
        bidder1.placeBidWithExtras(100, bidders);
        bidder2.placeBidWithExtras(150, bidders);
        bidder3.placeBidWithExtras(200, bidders);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The code is tangled, difficult to extend, and every new feature forces you to modify each bidder.
- It’s a maintenance nightmare! 😬💥

## Enter the Auction House: Our Mediator to the Rescue! 🚀😎

Now, let's bring in our savior—the Mediator Design Pattern. In our auction system, we'll create an `AuctionMediator` that centralizes all communication between bidders. This way, each bidder doesn't need to know about every other bidder. They simply communicate with the mediator, which takes care of the rest.

---

### Step 1: Defining the Mediator Interface

Our mediator will have methods to register bidders and handle bid placements.

```java
interface AuctionMediator {
    void registerBidder(Bidder bidder);
    void placeBid(Bidder bidder, int amount);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The mediator defines the contract for registering bidders and processing bids.

---

### Step 2: Building the Concrete Mediator – The Auction House

The Auction House will manage all bidder interactions.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
class AuctionHouse implements AuctionMediator {
    private List<Bidder> bidders = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void registerBidder(Bidder bidder) {
        bidders.add(bidder);
    }

    @Override
    public void placeBid(Bidder bidder, int amount) {
        System.out.println(bidder.getName() + " placed a bid of " + amount);
        for (Bidder b : bidders) {
            if (b != bidder) {
                b.receiveBid(bidder, amount);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `AuctionHouse` keeps a list of all registered bidders.
- When a bid is placed, it notifies all other bidders via the mediator.

---

### Step 3: Updating the Bidder Class to Work with the Mediator

Bidders now communicate only with the mediator.

```java
class Bidder {
    private String name;
    private AuctionMediator mediator;
    public Bidder(String name, AuctionMediator mediator) {
        this.name = name;
        this.mediator = mediator;
    }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void placeBid(int amount) { mediator.placeBid(this, amount); }
    public void receiveBid(Bidder bidder, int amount) {
        System.out.println(name + " is notified: " + bidder.getName() +
            " placed a bid of " + amount);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Each bidder holds a reference to the mediator instead of knowing about other bidders.
- This makes the code much cleaner and decoupled.

---

### Step 4: Bringing It All Together – The Clean Auction System

Now, let’s see our auction system using the mediator in action.

```java
public class AuctionMediatorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AuctionMediator auctionHouse = new AuctionHouse();
        Bidder bidder1 = new Bidder("Alice", auctionHouse);
        Bidder bidder2 = new Bidder("Bob", auctionHouse);
        Bidder bidder3 = new Bidder("Charlie", auctionHouse);
        auctionHouse.registerBidder(bidder1);
        auctionHouse.registerBidder(bidder2);
        auctionHouse.registerBidder(bidder3);
        bidder1.placeBid(100);
        bidder2.placeBid(150);
        bidder3.placeBid(200);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Bidders register with the `AuctionHouse`.
- When a bidder places a bid, the `AuctionHouse` (mediator) notifies all other bidders.
- The system is now organized, easy to extend, and much cleaner! 🎉

**Sample Output:**
```
Alice placed a bid of 100
Bob is notified: Alice placed a bid of 100
Charlie is notified: Alice placed a bid of 100
Bob placed a bid of 150
Alice is notified: Bob placed a bid of 150
Charlie is notified: Bob placed a bid of 150
Charlie placed a bid of 200
Alice is notified: Charlie placed a bid of 200
Bob is notified: Charlie placed a bid of 200
```

## Follow-Up: Extending the Auction System 🔥💡

Suppose the interviewer asks, “What if you want to add a new feature like logging each bid or integrating a bidding timer?” With our mediator pattern, you can simply extend the mediator without touching the bidder classes.

For example, you could modify the `AuctionHouse` to log each bid or check bid times. The beauty is that the core communication mechanism remains untouched, and new features are added in one centralized place. How neat is that? 😎

Here, we'll extend our existing `AuctionHouse` to create an `ExtendedAuctionHouse` that logs every bid and enforces a bidding timer. Bids submitted after the bidding period will be rejected.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
class ExtendedAuctionHouse extends AuctionHouse {
    private long biddingEndTime;  // Timestamp when bidding ends
    public ExtendedAuctionHouse(long biddingEndTime) {
        this.biddingEndTime = biddingEndTime;
    }
    @Override
    public void placeBid(Bidder bidder, int amount) {
        // Check if bidding time is still open
        if (System.currentTimeMillis() > biddingEndTime) {
            System.out.println("Bidding time is over. No more bids accepted.");
            return;
        }
        // Log the bid
        System.out.println("LOG: " + bidder.getName() + " is bidding " + amount);
        // Delegate to the original mediator logic to notify other bidders
        super.placeBid(bidder, amount);
    }
}
// Base AuctionHouse (from our previous implementation)
class AuctionHouse implements AuctionMediator {
    protected List<Bidder> bidders = new ArrayList<>();
    @Override
    public void registerBidder(Bidder bidder) {
        bidders.add(bidder);
    }
    @Override
    public void placeBid(Bidder bidder, int amount) {
        System.out.println(bidder.getName() + " placed a bid of " + amount);
        for (Bidder b : bidders) {
            if (b != bidder) {
                b.receiveBid(bidder, amount);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And here's how you might use this extended mediator in your main program:

```java
public class ExtendedAuctionMediatorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Set bidding end time to 5 seconds from now for demo purposes
        long biddingEndTime = System.currentTimeMillis() + 5000;
        AuctionMediator auctionHouse = new ExtendedAuctionHouse(biddingEndTime);
        Bidder bidder1 = new Bidder("Alice", auctionHouse);
        Bidder bidder2 = new Bidder("Bob", auctionHouse);
        Bidder bidder3 = new Bidder("Charlie", auctionHouse);
        auctionHouse.registerBidder(bidder1);
        auctionHouse.registerBidder(bidder2);
        auctionHouse.registerBidder(bidder3);
        bidder1.placeBid(100);
        Thread.sleep(2000);  // Wait 2 seconds
        bidder2.placeBid(150);
        Thread.sleep(4000);     // Wait additional 4 seconds (after bidding period)
        bidder3.placeBid(200);  // This bid should be rejected
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **ExtendedAuctionHouse:**
    - Inherits from `AuctionHouse`.
    - Adds a `biddingEndTime` to define when the bidding period expires.
    - Overrides the `placeBid()` method to:
        - Check if the current time exceeds the bidding end time.
        - Log each bid with a custom message.
        - Delegate to the base class method to notify other bidders if the bid is accepted.

- **Main Demo:**
    - Sets a bidding period (5 seconds in this demo).
    - Registers the bidders.
    - Demonstrates that bids placed after the bidding period are not accepted.

This follow-up code illustrates how easily you can extend your mediator to add new functionality like logging and timing, all without modifying your `Bidder` classes. It showcases the power and flexibility of the Mediator Design Pattern in making your system more scalable and maintainable. 😎👍

## The Marvelous Benefits of the Mediator Pattern 🚀

- **Reduced Coupling 🤝:**  
  The mediator centralizes communication between objects, so individual components don’t need to know about each other. This makes your code more modular and less dependent on tight interconnections.

- **Simplified Communication 📞:**  
  With a single mediator managing all interactions, the communication logic becomes clearer and easier to manage—no more tangled webs of direct object-to-object calls!

- **Enhanced Maintainability 🛠️:**  
  Since changes in communication are handled by the mediator, updates or modifications can be made in one place rather than throughout the entire system. This significantly improves maintainability.

- **Improved Scalability 🚀:**  
  Adding new components is much easier because they only need to interact with the mediator. This promotes scalability and reduces the risk of integration issues as your system grows.

- **Greater Reusability 🔄:**  
  Components remain self-contained and reusable in different contexts, since they don’t have hard-coded dependencies on other parts of the system.

---

## Real-Life Auction Magic and Beyond 🌍✨

The Mediator Pattern isn’t just for auction systems. Here are some everyday use cases where it shines:

- **Chat Rooms:**  
  A chat room server mediates communication between multiple clients without them needing to know each other.

- **Air Traffic Control:**  
  An air traffic controller (mediator) manages communication between all airplanes.

- **Smart Home Systems:**  
  A central hub coordinates various smart devices (lights, thermostats, security cameras) for smooth operation.

- **UI Components:**  
  Dialogs and widgets communicate through a mediator to keep the UI logic clean and modular.

---

## Wrapping Up Our Auction Adventure 🚀🎉

The Mediator Design Pattern is like having an organized auction house that manages all the communication between bidders. It prevents the chaos of direct communication and makes the system more flexible and maintainable. By centralizing interactions, you keep your code clean, decoupled, and ready for future extensions—be it adding logging, timers, or more features!
