# Visitor Design Pattern using a Hospital Scenario

Imagine our hospital where different kinds of patients come in for check-ups and treatments, and specialized doctors (our visitors) come in to perform various operations like diagnosis, billing, and more. Instead of burdening each patient with all these operations, we let the doctors visit them and do their magic! That’s the beauty of the Visitor Pattern—it separates operations from the objects they act upon. Let’s dive in! 🚀

## A Day at the Healing Hospital 🏥💉

Picture this: in our hospital, we have three kinds of patients—`ChildPatient`, `AdultPatient`, and `SeniorPatient`. Each patient type requires a tailored approach for tasks such as diagnosis and billing. Traditionally, each patient class might handle its own operations. But as new operations arise (say, a health report or medication calculation), you’d end up cluttering your classes with extra methods or endless if-else checks. Yikes! 😬

---

## The Traditional Treatment: The If-Else Way 😵

Let’s start with the traditional approach. Here, each patient class has its own methods, and in our main program, we decide what to do using type checks.

```java
// ChildPatient.java
class ChildPatient {
    public void diagnosis() {
        System.out.println("Diagnosing a child patient.");
    }
    public void billing() {
        System.out.println("Calculating billing for a child patient.");
    }
}

// AdultPatient.java
class AdultPatient {
    public void diagnosis() {
        System.out.println("Diagnosing an adult patient.");
    }
    public void billing() {
        System.out.println("Calculating billing for an adult patient.");
    }
}

// SeniorPatient.java
class SeniorPatient {
    public void diagnosis() {
        System.out.println("Diagnosing a senior patient.");
    }
    public void billing() {
        System.out.println("Calculating billing for a senior patient.");
    }
}

// In our main program:
public class HospitalTraditional {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object patient = new AdultPatient(); // Could be ChildPatient or SeniorPatient
        // Using if-else to perform operations
        if (patient instanceof ChildPatient) {
            ((ChildPatient) patient).diagnosis();
            ((ChildPatient) patient).billing();
        } else if (patient instanceof AdultPatient) {
            ((AdultPatient) patient).diagnosis();
            ((AdultPatient) patient).billing();
        } else if (patient instanceof SeniorPatient) {
            ((SeniorPatient) patient).diagnosis();
            ((SeniorPatient) patient).billing();
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `instanceof` checks to determine the patient type and then call the corresponding methods.
- It works for simple cases, but as you add more operations (like generating health reports), the code becomes tangled and repetitive. 😓

## Why “Visitor”? The Doctor’s Visit Analogy 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

The pattern is called Visitor because, much like a doctor who visits different patients to perform specialized operations, a visitor object "visits" each element (in our case, a patient) to carry out an operation. Instead of each patient class having a pile of methods, the visitor comes in and does its work. It’s like having a mobile doctor who doesn’t require every patient to know everything about healthcare! 😎

---

## The Ugly Prescription: A Messy If-Else Overload 😖

As our hospital grows, adding new operations makes the code even more complicated. Check out this tangled version:

```java
public class HospitalUgly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object patient = new SeniorPatient(); // Could be any patient type
        if (patient instanceof ChildPatient) {
            System.out.println("ChildPatient: Diagnose, Bill, Report, etc.");
        } else if (patient instanceof AdultPatient) {
            System.out.println("AdultPatient: Diagnose, Bill, Report, etc.");
        } else if (patient instanceof SeniorPatient) {
            System.out.println("SeniorPatient: Diagnose, Bill, Report, etc.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Every time a new operation is added, you must modify each patient’s type-check block.
- The code becomes ugly, hard to maintain, and nearly impossible to scale. 😬💥

## Meet the Specialist: Our Visitor Pattern Savior! 🚑✨

Time to introduce our savior—the Visitor Pattern! With this pattern, we can separate the operations (like diagnosis and billing) from the patient classes. This way, if we need to add a new operation, we simply create a new visitor, leaving the patient classes untouched. How cool is that? 😍

---

### Step 1: Define the Patient Interface

Every patient will implement an interface that lets them accept a visitor.

```java
interface Patient {
    void accept(Visitor visitor);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `accept` method lets a patient welcome a visitor, who will then perform the necessary operation.

---

### Step 2: Create Concrete Patient Classes

Here, our patients implement the `accept` method by calling the visitor’s appropriate visit method.

```java
// ChildPatient.java
class ChildPatient implements Patient {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// AdultPatient.java
class AdultPatient implements Patient {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}

// SeniorPatient.java
class SeniorPatient implements Patient {
    @Override
    public void accept(Visitor visitor) {
        visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Each patient class now simply “accepts” a visitor, delegating the operation to the visitor.
- No more if-else clutter in the patient classes!

---

### Step 3: Define the Visitor Interface

The visitor interface declares methods to handle each patient type.

```java
interface Visitor {
    void visit(ChildPatient childPatient);
    void visit(AdultPatient adultPatient);
    void visit(SeniorPatient seniorPatient);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- This interface defines a `visit` method for every type of patient.
- You can now add as many visitors (operations) as you need without modifying the patient classes.

---

### Step 4: Create Concrete Visitors

Let’s create a visitor for diagnosis first.

```java
class DiagnosisVisitor implements Visitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(ChildPatient childPatient) {
        System.out.println("Diagnosing a child patient: Check-up and pediatric care.");
    }
    @Override
    public void visit(AdultPatient adultPatient) {
        System.out.println("Diagnosing an adult patient: Routine exams and lifestyle advice.");
    }
    @Override
    public void visit(SeniorPatient seniorPatient) {
        System.out.println("Diagnosing a senior patient: Comprehensive geriatric evaluation.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `DiagnosisVisitor` encapsulates the logic for diagnosing patients of different types.
- It’s independent of the patient classes—perfect for adding new operations!

Now, suppose we also need to handle billing. We create another visitor:

```java
class BillingVisitor implements Visitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(ChildPatient childPatient) {
        System.out.println("Calculating billing for a child patient.");
    }
    @Override
    public void visit(AdultPatient adultPatient) {
        System.out.println("Calculating billing for an adult patient.");
    }
    @Override
    public void visit(SeniorPatient seniorPatient) {
        System.out.println("Calculating billing for a senior patient.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `BillingVisitor` is responsible for billing operations for each patient type.
- Notice how we can add it without altering any patient classes!

---

### Step 5: Bringing It All Together at the Hospital

Let’s see our visitor pattern in action.

```java
public class HospitalVisitorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an array of patients
        Patient[] patients = {
            new ChildPatient(), new AdultPatient(), new SeniorPatient()
        };
        // Create visitors for different operations
        Visitor diagnosisVisitor = new DiagnosisVisitor();
        Visitor billingVisitor = new BillingVisitor();
        // Each patient accepts the visitors to perform the operations
        for (Patient patient : patients) {
            patient.accept(diagnosisVisitor);
            patient.accept(billingVisitor);
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We have an array of various patients.
- We create our visitors (one for diagnosis and one for billing).
- Each patient “accepts” the visitors, and the respective operations are performed.
- The code is now clean, modular, and super easy to extend! 🎉

## Adding New Operations Without a Hitch 🔥💡

Imagine the interviewer asks, “How would you add a new operation, like generating a health report, without changing any patient classes?” With the Visitor Pattern, it’s as easy as creating a new visitor:

```java
class HealthReportVisitor implements Visitor {
    @Override
    public void visit(ChildPatient childPatient) {
        System.out.println("Generating health report for a child patient.");
    }
    @Override
    public void visit(AdultPatient adultPatient) {
        System.out.println("Generating health report for an adult patient.");
    }
    @Override
    public void visit(SeniorPatient seniorPatient) {
        System.out.println("Generating health report for a senior patient.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The new `HealthReportVisitor` can be used with the existing patient classes without any modifications.
- This demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of the Visitor Pattern! 😎

## The Marvelous Benefits of the Visitor Pattern 🚀

### Separation of Concerns 🤝

By decoupling operations from the objects they act upon, the Visitor Pattern keeps your code clean and modular. Patient classes (or any other elements) remain focused on their core responsibilities, while visitors handle the various operations like diagnosis, billing, or reporting.

### Ease of Adding New Operations 💡

Need to add a new feature, like generating a health report? No problem! Simply create a new visitor class without modifying the existing patient classes. This makes your code more scalable and easier to maintain.

### Double Dispatch Magic 🔄

The Visitor Pattern leverages double dispatch, allowing the operation executed to depend on both the type of visitor and the type of element. This lets you tailor behaviors specifically for different combinations without resorting to messy type checks.

### Simpler and Cleaner Element Classes 🧼

By offloading multiple operations to visitors, the element classes (e.g., `ChildPatient`, `AdultPatient`, `SeniorPatient`) stay lean and focused. They only need to implement a simple `accept` method, making them easier to understand and extend.

### Flexibility in Operations 🔧

The pattern allows you to change or extend operations independently of the object structure. Whether it's for reporting, billing, or any other future requirement, you can easily introduce new visitors without disrupting existing code.

## Real-Life Miracles: Where the Visitor Pattern Shines 🌍✨

- **Shopping Carts 🛒:**  
  Different items (books, electronics, groceries) can be visited by operations like discount calculation, tax computation, or shipping cost estimation.

- **File Systems 📁:**  
  Files and folders can be traversed by visitors to perform operations like indexing, virus scanning, or size calculation.

- **UI Components 🎨:**  
  Complex user interfaces can use visitors to apply themes, perform layout adjustments, or render components dynamically.

- **Tax Calculation Systems 💸:**  
  Different product types can be processed by visitors to calculate applicable taxes, ensuring each product is handled according to its rules.

---

## Wrapping Up Our Healing Journey 🚀🎉

The Visitor Design Pattern is like having a specialized doctor who visits each patient and performs the necessary operation, whether it’s diagnosing, billing, or generating a health report—without overloading the patient with extra code. This pattern makes your system cleaner, easier to maintain, and extremely flexible for future changes.
